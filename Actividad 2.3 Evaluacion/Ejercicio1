 I moved back to CDMX in 2016  , and traveling + experiencing new cultures is part of our adventures together with  my family.

What really excites me about being on the Airbnb network (hosting since 2016 and invited even before 2016) is the possibility of meeting new people, places and offering guests a safe and family home to enjoy the city , the ocean  and the mountains and enjoy the  locals. .   let us take you about an hour and a half outside Mexico City in Tepoztlán, Morelos or let 's get you to the Pacific Ocean to discover  great experience and love to share after many years of living  in Puerto Vallarta. 
Definitely I'd love and look forward to fill the needs of other members traveling around Mexico .
A bit more more of myself:
Playing music and  Djing, join meet up's and also get out to Tepoztlan , a great place for healing and spare time reading a book.
 Is a great honor to be able to get to know travelers around different countries and be hosting in Tepoztlán and Mexico City. I do Reflexology and is one another activity I  do practice home, so  please check on my services or else request a Temazcal (Sweat Lodge ) or a message.
 
Nacido en la Ciudad de México y criado en Puerto Vallarta. Todo lo que queremos es asegurarnos de que esté cómodo y asegurarle que la ciudad es fantástica para los amantes de la naturaleza y las historias urbanas. ¡Mi hermana y yo podemos darte excelentes consejos si quieres!

 Regresé a CDMX en 2016. viajar + experimentar nuevas culturas es parte de   aventuras junto con mi familia.

Lo que realmente me emociona de estar en la red de Airbnb (anfitrión desde 2016 e invitado incluso antes de 2016) es la posibilidad de conocer nuevas personas, lugares y ofrecer a los huéspedes un hogar seguro y familiar para disfrutar de la ciudad, el océano y las montañas y disfrutar del locales. . déjenos llevarlo aproximadamente una hora y media fuera de la Ciudad de México en Tepoztlán, Morelos o te llevemos al Océano Pacífico a descubrir una gran experiencia para compartirte después de muchos años de vivir en Puerto Vallarta.
Definitivamente me encantaría y espero satisfacer las necesidades de otros miembros que viajan por México.
Un poco más de mí mismo:
 Música y Djing,   reuniones y lo mejor es disfrutar Tepoztlán, un gran lugar para curarte y tiempo libre leyendo un libro.
 Es un gran honor poder conocer a viajeros de diferentes países y ser anfitriones en Tepoztlán y Ciudad de México. Hago reflexología y es otra actividad que practico, aqui en casa, así que por favor verifique mis servicios o solicite un Temazcal  o un mensaje.

All we want is to make sure you are comfortable and  assure you that the city is fantastic for nature lovers and urban stories. My sister and I can give you excellent advice if you like!

 I moved back to CDMX in 2016  , and traveling + experiencing new cultures is part of our adventures together with  my family.

What really excites me about being on the Airbnb network (hosting since 2016 and invited even before 2016) is the possibility of meeting new people, places and offering guests a safe and family home to enjoy the city , the ocean  and the mountains and enjoy the  locals. .   let us take you about an hour and a half outside Mexico City in Tepoztlán, Morelos or let 's get you to the Pacific Ocean to discover  great experience and love to share after many years of living  in Puerto Vallarta. 
Definitely I'd love and look forward to fill the needs of other members traveling around Mexico .
A bit more more of myself:
Playing music and  Djing, join meet up's and also get out to Tepoztlan , a great place for healing and spare time reading a book.
 Is a great honor to be able to get to know travelers around different countries and be hosting in Tepoztlán and Mexico City. I do Reflexology and is one another activity I  do practice home, so  please check on my services or else request a Temazcal (Sweat Lodge ) or a message.
 
Nacido en la Ciudad de México y criado en Puerto Vallarta. Todo lo que queremos es asegurarnos de que esté cómodo y asegurarle que la ciudad es fantástica para los amantes de la naturaleza y las historias urbanas. ¡Mi hermana y yo podemos darte excelentes consejos si quieres!

 Regresé a CDMX en 2016. viajar + experimentar nuevas culturas es parte de   aventuras junto con mi familia.

Lo que realmente me emociona de estar en la red de Airbnb (anfitrión desde 2016 e invitado incluso antes de 2016) es la posibilidad de conocer nuevas personas, lugares y ofrecer a los huéspedes un hogar seguro y familiar para disfrutar de la ciudad, el océano y las montañas y disfrutar del locales. . déjenos llevarlo aproximadamente una hora y media fuera de la Ciudad de México en Tepoztlán, Morelos o te llevemos al Océano Pacífico a descubrir una gran experiencia para compartirte después de muchos años de vivir en Puerto Vallarta.
Definitivamente me encantaría y espero satisfacer las necesidades de otros miembros que viajan por México.
Un poco más de mí mismo:
 Música y Djing,   reuniones y lo mejor es disfrutar Tepoztlán, un gran lugar para curarte y tiempo libre leyendo un libro.
 Es un gran honor poder conocer a viajeros de diferentes países y ser anfitriones en Tepoztlán y Ciudad de México. Hago reflexología y es otra actividad que practico, aqui en casa, así que por favor verifique mis servicios o solicite un Temazcal  o un mensaje.
