I am looking to provide the best possible experience for guests visiting the city while unlocking their creative potential! There is nothing more reassuring and calming than finding a place that feels like a second home on your travels. I try to provide the things I like when I travel, the social aspect plus the comfort part. I had the opportunity to know many places in the world and I infused this place with all my learnings. 

I enjoy getting in a good workout, whether it is through martial arts, yoga, skateboarding, or surfing. Sitting down and talking to different people from different cultures and backgrounds is helping me to grow as a person the most!

The artsy bohemian neighborhood felt like the ideal location for such space as it radiates the vibes I enjoy the most. I am looking to provide the best possible experience for guests visiting the city while unlocking their creative potential! There is nothing more reassuring and calming than finding a place that feels like a second home on your travels. I try to provide the things I like when I travel, the social aspect plus the comfort part. I had the opportunity to know many places in the world and I infused this place with all my learnings. 

I enjoy getting in a good workout, whether it is through martial arts, yoga, skateboarding, or surfing. Sitting down and talking to different people from different cultures and backgrounds is helping me to grow as a person the most!

Feel free to contact me with any questions you might have, or even if you want to say hi.

I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.

I'm passionate about sharing the best tips and hidden treasures to make your stay as memorable, fun, and authentic as possible so please don't hesitate to reach out! 

See you soon,

Chers futurs guests,

J’adore voyager et je suis donc souvent absente. À mes yeux la meilleure façon de découvrir une ville est en y vivant comme quelqu’un de local et cela passe, bien entendu, par le logement. C’est dans cette optique que lors de mes voyages je laisse mon logement à disposition des voyageurs du monde entier, alors : pourquoi pas vous ?  :)

Pas d’inquiétude, même si je ne suis pas présente lors de vos réservations, Jonathan, à lqui j’ai confié la gestion de mon logement, saura rendre votre séjour aussi agréable que possible !

A très vite,
Tamara.

Queridos futuros huespedes, 

Me fascina viajar y eso hace que me ausente de mi casa a menudo. Me encanta tambien abrir las puertas de mi casa a viajeros de todo el mundo. Creo que la mejor forma de conocer una ciudad es experimentarla como un local lo hace y como un local vive - que mejor forma de empezar tu viaje con el pie derecho que hospedarte en la casa de uno!

Me encanta compartir los mejores lugares y dar tips para que tu estancia en mi casa sea lo mas divertida, unica y autentica posible asi que, no dudes en escribirme!

Aunque no esté en Toronto, siempre contaras con el apoyo de algun amigo por cualquier emergencia y a mi me tendras al pendiente de cualquier texto o llamada. 

Nos vemos pronto!

I am an avid traveller, having lived in 7 different countries and 10 cities and travelled almost half the globe by now I concider myself a bit of a gypsy. I speak spanish, english and italian fluently, and a dash of french. I love eating, cooking, reading and as a painter I am on a constant quest for beauty and new experiences to enrich my life and art. I have a passion for diversity which allows me to enjoy in the same way a chilled glass of champagne at the Ritz in Paris as well as some salsa dripping tacos on the streets of Mexico City. I have a weakness for fashion that can sometimes get me in trouble as I no longer know where to put so many shoes...

2. Watching badass movies and TV series (game of thrones, breaking bad, dexter, arrested development, archer) 
3. Going out for beer in patios (I say beer to sound tough but secretly I like drinking cider and wine more than beer)
4. Having dinner with people I love
5. Imitating Carlton at random 90's dance parties 
6. Listening to music especially indie rock, folk, funk, hip-hop and soul. and I´m always looking for new things to listen to and love to share music with people that have similar tastes. 
7. Eating apple with nutella and/or peanut butter
8. Going to live music shows
